#Playing with DHT11 temperature & humidity sensors (3 & 4 pin versions)  
Looking from the front (grill part) of the sensor, from left to right:  
*For the 3 pins:  
 *data, vcc 5v, ground  
*For the 4 pins:  
 *vcc 5v, data, nothing, ground  
No resistance was used.  
In this example I use both types of sensors (with 3 and 4 pins)  
The first one (4 pins) it's connected to pin 7 on arduino  
The second one (3 pins) it's connected to pin 8
